BUILDBUILD APP
====

Notice
---
``` 
As The number of Our test code files is over 200,
Unified variables(module, object, ...) have been needed. 
In custom_msg.py, our repetitive messages are contained.
These message variables are applied to views of all apps.

Later, models(name, email, password, ...) in test case will be applied
in a file.
